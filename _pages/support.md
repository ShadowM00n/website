# Supporting me
Thanks for considering to support my work. It's much appreciated, and it helps me
to spend more time writing articles, tutorials, free software and promote more
free software.

I think free software is very important to have around, and all software made
should be released as free software.  As such, I will continue to keep working
on free software and it's promotion regardless of how much I receive in
(financial) funding.  However, more funding allows me to spend more time on
this.

## Funding platforms
I've set up a number of accounts on donation platforms. This way, you can
decide which platform you trust the most. The platforms I'm available on are:

- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/tyil/donate)
- [MakerSupport](https://www.makersupport.com/tyilanmenyn/pledge)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1401236)

If there are other platforms which you consider to be better, do let me know. I
am always open to suggestions, and I will try to make time to review other
platforms if possible. Such suggestions will also be incorporated in [my
article on Free software funding][article-funding].

## What's it used for?
Your donations will go towards paying the server I use to work and test things
on, `hyve2.tyil.net`.

If funding allows, I can look into possibilities to take time off of my day
time job in order to spend more time on free software work. It would also allow
me take more time off in order to attend conferences or give presentations on
my free software projects.
