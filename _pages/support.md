# Supporting me
Thanks for considering to support my work. It's much appreciated, and it helps me
to spend more time writing articles, tutorials, free software and promote more
free software.

## Funding platforms
I've set up a number of accounts on donation platforms. This way, you can
decide which platform you trust the most. The platforms I'm available on are:

- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/tyil/donate)
- [MakerSupport](https://www.makersupport.com/Vipersword/pledge)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1401236)

## What's it used for?
Your donations will go towards paying the server I use to work and test things
on, `hyve2.tyil.net`.
