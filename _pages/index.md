## About me
Freedom-focused hacker. I love everything about free software, and spend much
time contributing to it myself. I occasionally write articles to help other
people getting started with free software, and show the issues with proprietary
software. Active on IRC to help people out, and to learn about new things
myself as well. Currently I have made over 10 modules for Perl 6, which are all
available on CPAN.

If you think what I'm doing is awesome, and want to support me, you can do so
through donations. More information about how to donate and what I do with the
donations I receive can be found on the [donate][Donate] page.

## Contact
### PGP
My public PGP key is available on on [pgp.mit.edu][pubkey]. The fingerprint
is:`EB9E A484 1672 2D37 16F5  A799 9ACF E193 FFBC 1F50`

### OTR
For instant messaging I use OTR where possible. My fingerprints are the following:

- `973F92EA 4A45DE93 60C2C60E DDC049D5 149B3BE2` XMPP, tyil@national.shitposting.agency
- `B174A02B 1F0A4258 B1527988 770843B4 0582A0D8` IRC, tyil @ DareNET
- `C6025214 E05A4FB6 5E65B900 9CA6A7AF A4A35C48` IRC, tyil @ Gratisnode
- `80999DD8 22504629 44EC13E3 5C31BF2F FC825703` IRC, tyil @ Rizon

### Channels
####  Email
Email contact goes via [p.spek@tyil.work][mail]. Be sure to at least sign all
mail you send me. Even better would be encrypted mail using my [PGP
key][pubkey].

I do not read my mailboxes very often, so please do not expect a timely
response. If you require a response as soon as possible, please find me on IRC
instead.

#### IRC
I am mainly active as `tyil` on [DareNET][darenet]. Other networks I frequent
are [Gratisnode][freenode] and [Rizon][rizon], using the same nick, `tyil`. I
use OTR for private messages on IRC, so be sure you use this if you want to
discuss something in private.

#### XMPP
I am available via XMPP/Jabber on `tyil@national.shitposting.agency`. Like IRC,
be sure to have OTR enabled if you wish to talk to me. Since my XMPP chats go
via [`BitlBee`][bitlbee], the response time is about the same as via IRC.
